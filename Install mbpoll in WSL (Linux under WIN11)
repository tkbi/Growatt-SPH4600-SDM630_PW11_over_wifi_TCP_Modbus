 The fastest and safest way to install mbpoll is to use the APT repository from piduino.org
       ⟨http://apt.piduino.org⟩, so you should do the following :

              wget -O- http://www.piduino.org/piduino-key.asc | sudo apt-key add -
              sudo add-apt-repository 'deb http://apt.piduino.org stretch piduino'
              sudo apt update
              sudo apt install mbpoll

       This  repository  provides  mbpoll and libmodbus (version 3.1.4) packages for i386, amd64,
       armhf and arm64 architectures.  In the above commands, the repository is a Debian  Stretch
       distribution, but you can also choose Ubuntu Xenial by replacing stretch with xenial.
       It   may   be   necessary   to   install   the   software-properties-common   package  for
       add-apt-repository.
